        <p class="subheading">Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large knobs of butter</li>
                <li>1 large leek, washed and chopped into 2cm pieces</li>
                <li>200g mushrooms, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>x4 250g chicken breast fillets, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                <li>250ml chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
                <li>100ml double cream</li>
                <li>2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</li>
                <li>About 6 sheets of filo pastry</li>
                <li>Drizzle of olive oil</li>
                <li>Mash potato & veg, to serve</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="subheading">Method</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 190°C (fan 170°C, gas mark 5).</li>

                <li>Heat the butter in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the leek and mushrooms and fry for 2-3 minutes until they just start to soften.</li>

                <li>Crank up the heat to high, add the chicken pieces and fry for a further 2 minutes - the chicken won't be cooked through at this point - then pour in the chicken stock and let it come to a simmer.</li>

                <li>Meanwhile, mix the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of water until smooth, then pour into the pan, along with the cream. Bring back to the boil, stirring gently, and cook until the sauce thickens.</li>

                <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the spinach, then tip the whole lot into a pie dish about 28cm x 15cm. Set aside to cool a little.</li>

                <li>Take a sheet of filo and roughly crumple it in your hands - there is no right or wrong to this method! Place the crumpled filo on top of the chicken filling in the pie dish and repeat with the remaining filo sheets.</li>

                <li>Drizzle the pastry with olive oil, then bake the pie for about 20 minutes, by which time the filo will have crisped up and turned golden brown in places.</li>

                <li>Serve up your pie with fresh salad or some vegetables.</li>
            </ol>
